We systematically examines the vulnerability of USB cameras under electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack. In our experiments, we simulated EMP attacks using an insecticidal lamp (IL, generating EMP by releasing high voltage pulse) and a commercially available EMP generator. In addition, we evaluated the performance of the camera under various conditions by adjusting the number of filtering magnetic rings on the USB camera cable and the distance between the camera and the interference source.

The experimental results demonstrate that when fewer than 4 filtering magnetic rings or the distance between the camera and the interference source is less than 11 cm, the camera cannot be detected by the system. Although EMP attacks might not invariably cause image distortion or permanent damage, their covert nature can lead to false detection of system failures, data security and system maintenance. Based on these findings, it is recommended to determine the optimal number of shielding rings for cameras or their safe distance from EMP sources through the experimental approach outlined in this study, thereby enhancing the security and resilience of USB camera enabled IoT systems in specific scenarios.
